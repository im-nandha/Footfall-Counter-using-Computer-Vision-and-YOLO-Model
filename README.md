# Footfall-Counter-using-Computer-Vision-and-YOLO-Model
A footfall counting system using two methods: OpenCV-based background subtraction and YOLOv8 deep learning detection. People are tracked using centroid tracking, and IN/OUT counts are computed when they cross a defined ROI line. The project compares accuracy, speed, and real-time performance.
